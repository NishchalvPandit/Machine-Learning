## All you need to know about Linear regression
Linear regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict the value of a target variable by finding the best-fit line that minimizes the cost function, usually the Mean Squared Error (MSE). There are three main types:

- Simple Linear Regression: Involves two columns (one input and one output), where a single independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Involves multiple input columns, where more than one independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable.
- Polynomial Regression: Used when the relationship between variables is not linear, and a polynomial function is used to fit the data.
