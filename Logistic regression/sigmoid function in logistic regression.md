### Sigmoid Function in Logistic Regression

1. **Introduction to the Sigmoid Function:**  

   The sigmoid function transforms any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, defined as:
   σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

3. **Comparison to the Perceptron Trick:**  

   The perceptron trick focuses solely on misclassified points. In the perceptron method, the weight update rule is:
   w ← w + η (Y - Ŷ) x'  
   If Y - Ŷ = 0 (correctly classified), no update occurs, meaning classified points are not considered.
   

4. **Range of Inputs:**  

   The input z can take any real value from -∞ to +∞, allowing the sigmoid function to provide an output between 0 and 1. This captures uncertainty and models classified points as well.

6. **Probabilistic Interpretation:**  

   The sigmoid function operates on a probabilistic basis, providing the probability of both correctly classified and misclassified points. When z = 0 (where w · x_i = 0), the sigmoid value is 0.5, indicating uncertainty. 
   - If z > 0 (w · x_i > 0), the probability of being on the positive side is greater than 0.5.
   - If z < 0 (w · x_i < 0), the probability of being on the positive side is less than 0.5.

8. **Using the Sigmoid Function:**  

   In logistic regression, we use the weighted sum z = w · x' as input to the sigmoid function:
   Ŷ = σ(z)  
   where z = w · x_i.  
   The output Ŷ ranges from 0 to 1, capturing probabilities for all points, including classified ones.

10. **Advantages of the Sigmoid Function:**  
   
   - By considering all input points, not just misclassified ones, the sigmoid function provides a smoother gradient for optimization.
   - It allows for better convergence in training by accounting for probabilities rather than strict classifications.

### Summary  
The sigmoid function enhances the logistic regression model by incorporating all data points, providing a continuous output that represents probabilities. This is in contrast to the perceptron trick, which only updates weights based on misclassifications.
